## General Information

This project deploys a few AWS resources to validate the Terraform-compliance framework, thre scenarios have been defined:

- **Tag validation:**  validate that the whole resources created with the terraform code have the following tags with the respective value:
    | tags | value |
    | Owner | DanielR |
    | Environment | develop |
- **S3 encryption validation:** validate if the s3 buckets created has encryption enabled using KMS
- **Secret Manager validation:** validate if the retention policy for secret manager is equal to 10.

## General Steps

There are general steps that you must follow to launch the resources.

Before launching a resource you need to have in mind  the following:

            [PROFILE_NAME]
            aws_access_key_id = Replace_for_correct_Access_Key
            aws_secret_access_key = Replace_for_correct_Secret_Key
